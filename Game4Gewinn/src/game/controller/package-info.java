/**
 * Package of the controller class for Connect 4.
 * <p>
 * The controller handles the user input, modifies the model, and decides what the view should draw.
 * <p>
 * This package should contain the view and controller interfaces, since they are required to use the controller.
 * For example, there could be different view packages in the future, which all implement IGame4GewinnView and use
 * IGame4GewinnController.
